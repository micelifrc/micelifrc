- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Federico Miceli (@micelifrc)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development and game design
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program games with Unity
- I am a high school Math teacher, which implies that I'm interested in "mathematical" programming (aka algorithms, especially in Combinatorial Optimization).
